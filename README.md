# clickyMonsters

This application is a memory game built with React. It uses components to manage state and respond to user events. Game functionality controls clicks on the images to allow only one click per image during game play. The game auto-resets once all images are clicked or an image is clicked more than once. A JSON file holds the image information and game design uses Bootstrap.
